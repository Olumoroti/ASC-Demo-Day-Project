        <p class = "sub_content">
            Climate change refers to a broad range of global phenomena created predominantly by the recent warming of Earth’s surface (or global warming).
        </p>
        <p class = "sub_content">
            Note: While global warming and climate change are used interchangeably, global warming mostly refers only to the gradual warming of the Earth, while climate change encompasses both global warming and their effects.

    <div id = "causes_container" class="content_container">
            <p class = "sub_header">Causes of Climate Change</p>
            <p class = "sub_content">
                Naturally, the Earth’s climate changes due to multiple factors, including:
            </p>
            <ul class = "sub_content">
                <li>the Earth's orbit,</li>
                <li>the Earth's tilt,</li>
                <li>and the intensity of solar rays,</li>
            </ul>
            <p class = "sub_content">
                Natural events on Earth, such as volcanic eruptions, also affects Earth’s temperature.
            </p>
            <p class = "sub_content">
                Normally, the Earth’s atmosphere traps some of the Sun’s heat, creating a habitable surface. This is called the greenhouse effect. 
            </p>
            <p class = "sub_content">
                Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, wapor vapor, ozone, etc, make up the atmosphere and help trap the Sun’s energy. 
            </p>
            <p class = "sub_content">
                Human activities, mostly the burning of fossil fuels (oil, coal, natural gas), but also agriculture and land clearing, has led to increasing concentrations of these greenhouse gases, leading to more of the Sun’s energy being trapped in the atmosphere, warming the Earth.

                        Inform anyone you know about the danger of climate change, and what they can to do combat the threat. The more people that fight against climate change, the cleaner the Earth can become.
